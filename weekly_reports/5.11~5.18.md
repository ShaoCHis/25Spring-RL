Review code and construct the code structure

We used CartPole from OpenAI Gym as the simulation environment.

we construct the model repository as:
```python
---------main.py  # the main function,whole project entrance
    ｜
    ｜---algorithm_dp # the dynamic algorithm of value and policy folder
    ｜
    ｜---algorithm_rl # the rl algorithm (Actor-Critic PPO algorithm) folder
    ｜
    ｜---eniviroments # the needed enviroments for the project folder,such as gym
    ｜
    ｜---models # model folder
    ｜
    ｜---chief_workers # the Iot simulation folder 
```

the project files will be constrcuted as the structure.That's our later work.
